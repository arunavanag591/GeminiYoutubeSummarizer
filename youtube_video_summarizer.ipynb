His focus turned to unclimbed walls and places where climate research has been minimal. In particular, the Ingmikortilaq Wall in Greenland captivated him. Despite the treacherous conditions and limited knowledge of the rock formation, Honnold assembled a team of expert climbers to join him in this daring expedition. The team recognized the risks involved but were determined to make a significant impact through research and exploration. As they prepared to face the daunting wall, they encountered harsh weather conditions, adding to the already perilous nature of the climb."
